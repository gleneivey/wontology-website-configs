This is the press page for [http://adasdaughters.org/ AdasDaughters.org], a web site organizing a list of notable women in technology and science inspired by [http://findingada.com/ Ada Lovelace Day].

== Summary ==

[http://adasdaughters.org/ Ada's Daughters] was launched for the 2010 Ada Lovelace Day (March 24th).  It was originally seeded with references to a number of the women who were blogged about for ALD-2009.  <tt>AdasDaughters.org</tt> is a publicly-editable community site, like a wiki, and while anyone is welcome to add information regarding any notable woman in technology or science, historical or current, participants in Ada Lovelace Day are especially encouraged to add links to their work to the site.
