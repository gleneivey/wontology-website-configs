Welcome.  This site is a publicly-editable collection of facts and information regarding notable women in the fields of technology and science, inspired by the [http://findingada.com/ Ada Lovelace Day project] to celebrate technical women.

This index is structured as a network of items and their interconnections.  It is a "[[Help:GlossaryPtoZ#anchor_Wontology|wontology]]", named by combining "''w''iki" (publicly editable, collaborative, community created) with "''ontology''" (a knowledge representation made up of concepts and their interconnections).

As it is an openly-editable system, ''you are encouraged to add to and revise'' the information stored here.  To get started, try [[Adas_Daughters:Contributing|Adding Content]], our [[Help:Main Page|top-level online help page]], or [[Help:Wontology Concepts|Wontology Concepts]].

Information is represented here using the general mechanism of [[Help:GlossaryAtoO#Connection|connections]] between [[Help:GlossaryAtoO#Item|items]], which allows virtually any set of facts and relationships to be stored.  In <tt>AdasDaughters.org</tt>, "items" include entries representing individual "notable women," as well as each of the many different categories and fields of work a woman can be associated with in the system.

(The content of the site is freely available for other people's modification and reuse under the terms of the [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl.html GNU Free Documentation License].  In order to permit this licensing, by contributing content to this site, you assign the copyright of that content to the site owner.)

Note that, at the moment, we don't have separate user logins and we don't yet have the ability for contributors to reverse (roll-back) erroneous changes to the data.  You are absolutely welcome and encouraged to modify, expand, and improve the information stored here.  Please make all the additions you want&mdash;we ask only that you be slightly more hesitant to remove information contributed by others (data items or large chunks of an item's description) than to make new contributions of your own.

This site is hosted using the [[Help:GlossaryPtoZ#WontoMedia|WontoMedia]] web application software, which is free to use to create your own wontology site as well.
